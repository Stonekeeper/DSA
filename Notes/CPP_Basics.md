Import <iostream> for all types of I/O.
Alternatively we can use <bits/stdc++.h> to include all the standard libraries in C++.

Basic template

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
int main () {
	cout << "Hello World..!"
	return 0;
}
```

# Data Types

- int
- long 
- long long
- float
- double
- char
- string & getline()
	Note: The Use getline() to take space seperated string as input,
		  Also note that getline() considers \n as a input


# Note 
1. & is used in function to pass the value as reference
2. Arrays are by default passed by reference and there is no need to specify &.
