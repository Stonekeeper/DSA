Time complexity != Time take

### What is TC?
The rate at which the time taken increases with respect to the input size.
TC is represented using Big O Notation = O(<TC>)

### 3 Rules to Compute TC?
1. Always assume the worst case.
2. Avoid constants
3. Avoid lower values

a. Big O (Worst Case)
b. Theta (Average Case)
c. Omega (Best Case)

## Space Complexity

Space Complexity = Auxiliary Space + Input space 

1. Auxiliary Space = The extra space used to store the results or processed data from the input.
3. Input Space = The space that is used to store the input data.
